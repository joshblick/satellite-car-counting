The script here is not as a jupyter notebook unfortunate as I coded it using spyder before realising Jupyter would
save me documentation later on.

To run the scraping I use selenium. TO operate it reuires a file called "chromedriver" which automates chrome and 
sits in the python directory. Installation instructions are here:
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=87.0.4280.88/

The script produces (after quite a while) a long list of all the walmart stores.
